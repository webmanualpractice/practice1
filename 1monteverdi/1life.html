  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>I. Historical background</h1>
    Monteverdi is usually described as an "Italian" composer, even though in his
    lifetime the concept of "Italy" existed only as a geographical entity.
    Although the inhabitants of the peninsula shared much in common in terms of
    history, culture and language, in political terms the people experienced
    various layers of authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they
    were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families
    such as the Gonzagas (rulers of the Duchy of Mantua). Cremona, part of the
    Duchy of Milan, fell under the control of the Spanish Empire from 1559.

    <h1>II. Cremona: 1567–1591</h1>
    Monteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15
    May 1567. The register records his name as "Claudio Zuan Antonio" the son of
    "Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo". He was the first child of the apothecary
    Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (née Zignani); they had
    married early the previous year. Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi
    (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and
    two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent
    marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of
    Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by the Duchy of Mantua, in
    both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career. Cremona
    Cathedral, where Monteverdi's teacher Ingegneri was maestro di capella There
    is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or evidence that
    (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied
    at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a set of motets,
    Sacrae cantiunculae (Sacred Songs) for three voices, was issued in Venice in
    1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial
    publications, he describes himself as the pupil of Marc'Antonio Ingegneri,
    who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the maestro di cappella
    at Cremona Cathedral. The musicologist Tim Carter deduces that Ingegneri
    "gave him a solid grounding in counterpoint and composition", and that
    Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the viol family
    and singing. Monteverdi's first publications also give evidence of his
    connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published
    work, Madrigali spirituali (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at
    Brescia. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets
    of five-part madrigals, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri: "the
    inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the
    sixteenth century ... the secular genre par excellence". The first book of
    madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verità of Verona; the
    second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of
    the Senate of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the viola da
    braccio in 1587.

    <h1>III. Mantua: 1591–1613</h1>
    <h2>1. Court musician</h2>
    In the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described
    himself as a player of the vivuola (which could mean either viola da gamba
    or viola da braccio). In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke
    Vincenzo I Gonzaga of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of
    his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that "the most noble exercise of
    the vivuola opened to me the fortunate way into your service." In the same
    dedication he compares his instrumental playing to "flowers" and his
    compositions as "fruit" which as it matures "can more worthily and more
    perfectly serve you", indicating his intentions to establish himself as a
    composer. Duke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre,
    and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua,
    the maestro di capella at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de
    Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the
    composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister, the singer Madama
    Europa, and Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de
    Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b.
    1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in
    1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.
    When Wert died in 1596, his post was given to Benedetto Pallavicino, but
    Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on
    his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in
    1599. Here at the town of Spa he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as
    encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the canto alla francese. (The
    meaning of this, literally "song in the French style", is debatable, but may
    refer to the French-influenced poetry of Gabriello Chiabrera, some of which
    was set by Monteverdi in his Scherzi musicali, and which departs from the
    traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables). Monteverdi may
    possibly have been a member of Vincenzo's entourage at Florence in 1600 for
    the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV of France, at which
    celebrations Jacopo Peri's opera Euridice (the earliest surviving opera) was
    premiered. On the death of Pallavicino in 1601, Monteverdi was confirmed as
    the new maestro di capella.

    <h2>2. controversy and seconda pratica</h2>
    At the turn of the 17th century, Monteverdi found himself the target of
    musical controversy. The influential Bolognese theorist Giovanni Maria
    Artusi attacked Monteverdi's music (without naming the composer) in his work
    L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the
    imperfections of modern music) of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi
    cited extracts from Monteverdi's works not yet published (they later formed
    parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605),
    condemning their use of harmony and their innovations in use of musical
    modes, compared to orthodox polyphonic practice of the sixteenth century.
    Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer
    refused to respond, but found a champion in a pseudonymous supporter,
    "L'Ottuso Academico" ("The Obtuse Academic"). Eventually Monteverdi replied
    in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court
    prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to "the studious reader",
    he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, Seconda Pratica, overo
    Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern
    Music). This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio's
    brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the seconda pratica which
    Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as a radical change or his own
    invention, but was an evolution from previous styles (prima pratica) which
    was complementary to them. This debate seems in any case to have raised the
    composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals.
    Some of his madrigals were published in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the
    poet Tommaso Stigliani (1573-1651) published a eulogy of him in his 1605
    poem "O sirene de' fiumi". The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist
    Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: "I must not neglect to mention the most
    noble of composers, Monteverdi ... his expressive qualities are truly
    deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless
    examples of matchless declamation ... enhanced by comparable harmonies." The
    modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the
    context of Monteverdi's artistic development: "If the controversy seems to
    define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about
    stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown". The
    non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised explanatory treatise may have been a
    deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become
    fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by
    then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the
    other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi
    was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise
    entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on this at the time of his
    death ten years later.

    <h2>3. Opera, conflict and departure</h2>
    In 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco commissioned from Monteverdi the opera
    L'Orfeo, to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of
    1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers
    included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of
    Euridice witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the
    opera L'Arianna (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for the
    celebration of the marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the
    music for this opera is lost apart from Ariadne's Lament, which became
    extremely popular.[n 4] To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment
    Il ballo delle ingrate. The strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been
    putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal
    tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer Caterina
    Martinelli, intended for the title role of Arianna, died of smallpox in
    March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial
    treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and
    wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November
    of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) "an honourable dismissal". Although
    the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned
    to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere.
    After publishing his Vespers in 1610, which were dedicated to Pope Paul V,
    he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a seminary,
    but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may
    also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was
    being printed, with a similar intention. Duke Vincenzo died on 18 February
    1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting led to
    the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both
    returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco's own death from
    smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with
    his successor, his brother Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga. In 1613, following
    the death of Giulio Cesare Martinengo, Monteverdi auditioned for his post as
    maestro at the basilica of San Marco in Venice, for which he submitted music
    for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 ducats for his
    expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by
    highwaymen at Sanguinetto on his return to Cremona).

    <h1>IV. Venice: 1613–1643</h1>
    <h2>1. Maturity: 1613–1630</h2>
    Martinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the
    music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the
    administration overlooked.[37] When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post,
    his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage
    the musicians of San Marco (the capella), who amounted to about 30 singers
    and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major
    events.[38] Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who
    joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco
    throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with
    Monteverdi.[39] Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including
    not only the traditional a cappella repertoire of Roman and Flemish
    composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured,
    including the use of continuo and other instruments.[38] Apart from this he
    was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the
    church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas
    Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many
    of which are lost).[40] Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by
    providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was
    frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators
    of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their
    satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300
    ducats to 400.[41] The relative freedom which the Republic of Venice
    afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are
    reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13
    March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his
    present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which
    Mantua still owes him.[42] Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he
    accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally
    renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state.
    These included the balli Tirsi e Clori (1616) and Apollo (1620), an opera
    Andromeda (1620) and an intermedio, Le nozze di Tetide, for the marriage of
    Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were
    extensively delayed in creation – partly, as shown by surviving
    correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and
    partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements.[n 5] They
    are now lost, apart from Tirsi e Clori, which was included in the seventh
    book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina,
    for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the
    Duchess.[36][41][44] A subsequent major commission, the opera La finta pazza
    Licori, to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's
    successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the
    latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now
    also lost.[36] Monteverdi also received commissions from other Italian
    states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the
    Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and
    for the Florentine community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de' Medici
    (1621).[41] Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of
    Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco
    Petratti.[46] Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman
    Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic
    entertainment Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda based on an episode
    from Torquato Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata.[47] In 1627 Monteverdi
    received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, for a
    series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there
    during 1627 and 1628.[36] Monteverdi's musical direction received the
    attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician Constantijn
    Huygens, attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni e Lucia,
    wrote that he "heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It
    was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi ... who was also the
    composer and was accompanied by four theorbos, two cornettos, two bassoons,
    one basso de viola of huge size, organs and other instruments ...".[48]
    Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the
    visit to Venice in 1625 of the Crown Prince Władysław of Poland, who may
    have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure
    Monteverdi to Warsaw.[41] He also provided chamber music for Wolfgang
    Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg, when the latter was paying an incognito
    visit to Venice in July 1625.[49] Correspondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and
    1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in
    alchemy, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses
    experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining mercury,
    and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the
    glassworks at Murano.[50] Despite his generally satisfactory situation in
    Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was
    on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – the
    subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging
    that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his
    children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was
    spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he,
    therefore, moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the
    required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco
    having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His
    other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the
    Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi
    was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to
    pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the
    time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be
    subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money
    worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for
    himself a church canonry.[41][51]
    <h2>2. Pause and priesthood: 1630–1637</h2>
    A series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi's world in the period
    around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the
    plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and
    dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally
    Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and over a
    period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population
    in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among
    the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable
    composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the
    after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and
    artistic life of Venice.[52][53][54] Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio
    Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.[21] By this time
    Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have
    slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's Proserpina rapita (The
    Abduction of Proserpina), now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo
    wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San
    Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of Scherzi musicali was
    published in Venice in 1632.[41] In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the
    tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these
    ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of the clergy
    of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.[53][54]

    <h2>3. Late flowering: 1637–1643</h2>
    The opening of the opera house of San Cassiano in 1637, the first public
    opera house in Europe, stimulated the city's musical life[54] and coincided
    with a new burst of the composer's activity. The year 1638 saw the
    publication of Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the
    Ballo delle ingrate. The eighth book contains a ballo, "Volgendi il ciel",
    which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, to
    whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640–1641 saw the publication of the
    extensive collection of church music, Selva morale e spirituale. Among other
    commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi's
    "Accademia degli Unisoni" in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, La vittoria
    d'Amore, for the court of Piacenza.[55][56] Monteverdi was still not
    entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He
    wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June
    1637: "I, Claudio Monteverdi ... come humbly ... to set forth to you how
    Domenicato Aldegati ... a bass, yesterday morning ... at the time of the
    greatest concourse of people ... spoke these exact words ...'The Director of
    Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking,
    he-goat ... and I shit on him and whoever protects him ...'".[57][n 6]
    Monteverdi's contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his
    earlier opera L'Arianna in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial
    stage, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland,
    1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), Le nozze d'Enea e
    Lavinia (The Marriage of Aeneas and Lavinia, 1641, music now lost), and
    L'incoronazione di Poppea (The Coronation of Poppea, 1643).[59] The
    introduction to the printed scenario of Le nozze d'Enea, by an unknown
    author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of
    theatrical music and that "he will be sighed for in later ages, for his
    compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time."[60] In his last
    surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping
    for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the
    Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf.[61] He died in Venice on 29
    November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the
    Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661,
    Francesco after 1677.[36]
