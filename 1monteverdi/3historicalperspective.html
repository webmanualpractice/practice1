    <title>Monteverdi - Historical perspective</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    In his lifetime Monteverdi enjoyed considerable status among musicians and
    the public. This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: "[W]ith
    truly royal pomp a catafalque was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de
    Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that
    the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars".[132] This
    glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi's day, music
    rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was
    quickly forgotten along with its creator.[133] In this regard Monteverdi
    fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in
    the decade following his death;[134] according to Severo Bonini, writing in
    1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the Lamento
    d'Arianna.[135] The German composer Heinrich Schütz, who had studied in
    Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli shortly before Monteverdi's arrival there,
    possessed a copy of Il combattimento and himself took up elements of the
    stile concitato. On his second visit to Venice in 1628–1629, Arnold
    believes, Schütz absorbed the concepts of basso continuo and expressiveness
    of word-setting, but he opines that Schütz was more directly influenced by
    the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi
    and Giovanni Rovetta (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San
    Marco).[136] Schütz published a first book of Symphoniae sacrae, settings of
    biblical texts in the style of seconda pratica, in Venice in 1629. Es steh
    Gott auf, from his Symphoniae sacrae II, published in Dresden in 1647,
    contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.[137] After the 1650s,
    Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music
    generally forgotten except for the Lamento, the prototype of a genre that
    would endure well into the 18th century.[134] Interest in Monteverdi revived
    in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany
    and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical
    curiosity.[133] Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when
    Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score.[138] Around
    this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but
    more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of
    the L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904.[139]
    Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged
    in one form or another, during the first quarter of the 20th century:
    L'Orfeo in May 1911,[140] L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in
    May 1925.[141] The Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded
    Monteverdi and in his novel Il fuoco (1900) wrote of "il divino Claudio ...
    what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!" His vision of Monteverdi
    as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who
    worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922–1945), including Gian
    Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted
    Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude
    Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.[142] In the years after the Second World War
    the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually
    were established in the general repertory.[143] The resuscitation of
    Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic
    Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that
    Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed
    chiefly as a secular composer.[133] It was not until 1932 that the 1610
    Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision
    two years later. Modern editions of the Selva morale and Missa e Salmi
    volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.[144] The revival of
    public interest in Monteverdi's music gathered pace in the second half of
    the 20th century, reaching full spate in the general early-music revival of
    the 1970s, during which time the emphasis turned increasingly towards
    "authentic" performance using historical instruments.[145] The magazine
    Gramophone notes over 30 recordings of the Vespers between 1976 and 2011,
    and 27 of Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda between 1971 and
    2013.[146] Monteverdi's surviving operas are today regularly performed; the
    website Operabase notes 555 performances of the operas in 149 productions
    worldwide in the seasons 2011–2016, ranking Monteverdi at 30th position for
    all composers, and at 8th ranking for Italian opera composers.[147] In 1985,
    Manfred H. Stattkus published an index to Monteverdi's works, the
    Stattkus-Verzeichnis, (revised in 2006) giving each composition an "SV"
    number, to be used for cataloguing and references.[148] Monteverdi is lauded
    by modern critics as "the most significant composer in late Renaissance and
    early Baroque Italy";[149] "one of the principal composers in the history of
    Western music";[150] and, routinely, as the first great opera composer.[151]
    These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was
    largely unknown to the composers who followed him during an extensive
    period, spanning more than two centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich
    and others have pointed out, the composers of the 20th and 21st century who
    have rediscovered Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their
    own.[152][153] Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by
    Monteverdi's reputation as "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the
    Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority"[153] – although the
    composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, "showing what can only be described
    as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for
    the purpose".[153] In a letter dated 16 October 1633, Monteverdi appears to
    endorse the view of himself as a "modern": "I would rather be moderately
    praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary".[154]
    However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as
    facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same
    time protective of his status as a competent composer in the stile antico.
    Thus, says Chew, "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive".
    Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing
    up much of the early Baroque. "And in one respect in particular, his
    achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in
    music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music."[153]
