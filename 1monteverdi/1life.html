    <title>Monteverdi - Life</title>

  <body>
    <h1>Historical background</h1>
    Monteverdi is usually described as an "Italian" composer, even though in his
    lifetime the concept of "Italy" existed only as a geographical entity.
    Although the inhabitants of the peninsula shared much in common in terms of
    history, culture and language, in political terms the people experienced
    various layers of authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they
    were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families
    such as the Gonzagas (rulers of the Duchy of Mantua). Cremona, part of the
    Duchy of Milan, fell under the control of the Spanish Empire from 1559.

    <h1>Cremona: 1567–1591</h1>
    Monteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15
    May 1567. The register records his name as "Claudio Zuan Antonio" the son of
    "Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo". He was the first child of the apothecary
    Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (née Zignani); they had
    married early the previous year. Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi
    (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and
    two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent
    marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of
    Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by the Duchy of Mantua, in
    both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.[10]
    Cremona Cathedral, where Monteverdi's teacher Ingegneri was maestro di
    capella There is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or
    evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral
    choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a
    set of motets, Sacrae cantiunculae (Sacred Songs) for three voices, was
    issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and
    his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of
    Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592
    the maestro di cappella at Cremona Cathedral. The musicologist Tim Carter
    deduces that Ingegneri "gave him a solid grounding in counterpoint and
    composition", and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing
    instruments of the viol family and singing. Monteverdi's first publications
    also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early
    years. His second published work, Madrigali spirituali (Spiritual Madrigals,
    1583), was printed at Brescia. His next works (his first published secular
    compositions) were sets of five-part madrigals, according to his biographer
    Paolo Fabbri: "the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second
    half of the sixteenth century ... the secular genre par excellence". The
    first book of madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verità
    of Verona; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the
    President of the Senate of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played
    the viola da braccio in 1587.
